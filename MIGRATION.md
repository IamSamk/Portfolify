# Portfolio Designer - Migration to Tldraw

## What Changed

We successfully migrated from a custom Konva.js-based canvas implementation to **Tldraw**, a powerful open-source canvas library. This change provides:

### Benefits of Tldraw Integration

1. **Professional Drawing Tools**: Built-in drawing tools including shapes, text, arrows, and freehand drawing
2. **Advanced Features**: Multi-selection, grouping, layers, undo/redo, zoom, pan
3. **Better User Experience**: Intuitive interface that users are familiar with
4. **Less Maintenance**: No need to maintain custom drawing logic
5. **More Features Out-of-the-Box**: 
   - Text editing with rich formatting
   - Shape tools (rectangle, circle, arrow, line, etc.)
   - Drawing and eraser tools
   - Selection and transformation tools
   - Export capabilities

### Files Moved to Backup

The following files from the custom implementation have been moved to the `backup/` folder:

- `PortfolioDesigner.tsx` (custom Konva implementation)
- `Toolbar.tsx` (custom toolbar component)
- `PortfolioDesigner.css` (complex CSS for custom UI)

### New Implementation

- **Simplified PortfolioDesigner.tsx**: Now uses Tldraw component with minimal custom code
- **Cleaner CSS**: Much simpler styling focused on layout and integration
- **Better Dependencies**: Replaced `konva` and `react-konva` with `tldraw`

## Current Features

✅ **Professional Canvas**: Full-featured drawing canvas with Tldraw
✅ **All Drawing Tools**: Shapes, text, drawing, selection, etc.
✅ **Preview Generation**: Still works with existing backend
✅ **AI Generation**: Modal integration preserved
✅ **Admin Panel**: Admin functionality maintained
✅ **Deployment**: Vercel deployment integration intact

## Usage

1. **Drawing**: Use the built-in Tldraw toolbar for all drawing operations
2. **Preview**: Click "Preview" to generate HTML from your design
3. **AI Generate**: Use AI to create designs automatically
4. **Admin**: Access admin panel for configuration

## Dependencies

- `tldraw`: Modern canvas library with professional drawing tools
- `react`: Core React framework
- `typescript`: Type safety
- Removed: `konva`, `react-konva` (no longer needed)

## Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application now runs with a much cleaner, more maintainable codebase while providing superior drawing capabilities through Tldraw.
